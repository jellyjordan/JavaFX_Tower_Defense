JavaFX_Tower_Defense
====================
Made by Jordan La Croix

A simple tower defense game powered by the JavaFX framework. Users manage resources to build towers which help defend them from monsters. Monsters are spawned in waves which scale as the game progresses, and only ends when the player runs out of lives.
